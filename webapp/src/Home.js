            <h1>Metroids are throughout the series shown to be highly adaptive to outside stimuli. The original Metroid established that exposure to beta rays would cause Metroids to multiply very quickly.[4]

Metroid II: Return of Samus and the remake Metroid: Samus Returns established a five-stage life cycle in which those Metroids native to their home planet SR388 go through two stages of ecdysis followed by two stages of mutation, thus maturing through five previously unknown forms: Alpha Metroid, Gamma Metroid, Zeta Metroid, Omega Metroid, and the uncommon Queen Metroid.[4] They are frequently shown to be vulnerable to ice-based weaponry such as the Ice Beam and freeze guns. These weapons can freeze most Metroids instantly, and often all it takes to finish them off after this is a strong impact such as one from a missile.

The Metroids were originally bio-engineered by a faction of the ancient Chozo race in order to combat the X Parasites on SR388, but they turned against their masters, forcing the latter to leave the planet.</h1>
